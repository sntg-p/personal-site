A company wanted to stop using spreadsheets to handle work orders management so I made a web app for them using Polymer and PHP (because I didn't know any better).

This app enabled the company to create work orders, track resource (people, vehicles, equipment) availability and associated costs. I also learned MySQL for this project.
