A company wanted to stop using spreadsheets to handle work orders management so I made a web app for them.
---

This was my first fullstack web app development project. It enabled the company to create work orders, track resources (people, vehicles, equipment) availability and associated costs.

I had very little JS, PHP and Polymer experience before this project, and no database knowledge.
