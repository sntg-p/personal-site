I made a design for a file explorer app using the Material guidelines and wanted to make it real. I also thought it could be a good oportunity to try Electron.

Sadly I lost the source code of this one. It wasn't finished and didn't gave it much more time than a week before I moved on to another things.

*the app actually really resembled the mockup except the folder tree was missing and that instead of breadcrumbs there was just a text input*
