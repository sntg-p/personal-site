I was using Unreal for archviz but didn't like Blueprint visual programming, so I started playing with Unity and C# which seemed more familiar to me.

The game randomly connects road segments and populates the level with people, houses, power-ups, etc. I couldn't get the physics of the car right and couldn't get bothered enough to fix it.
