We inherited an RF-enabled alarm from another grade in school and replaced the custom PIC-based board with an Arduino, added a GSM module and kept the RF control board.

I worked on small parts of the custom firmware and developed a simple app to activate or stop the alarm at will. More than thirty units are installed throughout [Campana, Buenos Aires](https://goo.gl/maps/8tWAMk1P5wH4dP2o9).
